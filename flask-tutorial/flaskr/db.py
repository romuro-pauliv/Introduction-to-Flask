# | Define and Access the Database |
# +--------------------------------+

"""
The application will use a SQLite database to store users and posts. Python comes with built-in support for SQLite in
the sqlite3 module.

SQLite is convenient because it doesn't require setting up a separate database server and is built-in to Python. However
if concurrent requests try to write to the database at the same time, they will slow down as each write happens sequen -
tially. Small applications won't notice this. Once you become big, you may want to switch to a different database.

The tutorial doesn't go into detail about SQL. If you are not familiar with it, the SQLite docs describe the language:
