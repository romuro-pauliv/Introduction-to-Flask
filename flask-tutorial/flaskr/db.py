# | Define and Access the Database |
# +--------------------------------+

"""
The application will use a SQLite database to store users and posts. Python comes with built-in support for SQLite in
the sqlite3 module.

SQLite is convenient because it doesn't require setting up a separate database server and is built-in to Python. However
if concurrent requests try to write to the database at the same time, they will slow down as each write happens sequen -
tially. Small applications won't notice this. Once you become big, you may want to switch to a different database.

The tutorial doesn't go into detail about SQL. If you are not familiar with it, the SQLite docs describe the language:
https://sqlite.org/lang.html
"""

# +-------------------------+
# | Connect to the Database |
# +-------------------------+

"""
The first thing to do when working with a SQLite database (and most other Python database libraries) is to create a con-
nection to it. Any queries and operations are performed using the connection, which is cosed after the work is finished.

In web applications this connection is typically tied to the request. It is created at some point when handling a re-
quest, and closed before the response is sent.

def get_db():
    if 'db' not in g:
        g.db = sqlite3.connect(
            current_app.config['DATABASE'],
            detect_types=sqlite3.PARSE_DECLTYPES
        )
        g.db.row_factory = sqlite3.Row

    return g.db


def close_db(e=None):
    db = g.pop('db', None)
    
    if db is not None:
        db.close()


"""
g is a special object that is unique for each request. It is used to store data that might be accessed by multiple func-
tions during the request. The connection is stored and reused instead of creating a new connection if get_db is called a
second time in the same request.

current_app is another special object taht points to the Flask application handling the request. Since you used an
application factory, there is no application object when writing the request of your code. get_db will be called when
the application has been created and is handling a request, so current_app can be used.

sqlite3_connect() establishes a connection to the file pointed at by the DATABASE configuration key. This file doesn't 
have to exist yet. and won't until initialize the database later.

sqlite3.Row tells the connection to return rows that behave like dicts. This allows accessing the columns by name.

close_db() checks if a connection was created by checking if g.db was set. If the connection exists, it is closed.
Further down you will tell your application about the close_db function in the application factory so that it is called 
after each request.
"""

# +-------------------+
# | Create the Tables |
# +-------------------+

"""
In SQLite, data is stored in tables and columns. These need to be created before you can store and retrive data. Flaskr
will store users in the user table. and posts in the post table. Create a file with the SQL commands needed to create 
empty tables:

view in flaskr/schema.sql

add the functions that will run these SQL commands to the db.py file.
"""

@click.command('init-db')
def init_db_command():
    """Clear the existing data and create new tables"""
    init_db()
    click.echo('Initialized the database.')


"""
open_resorce() opens a file relative the the flaskr package, which is useful since you won't necessarily know that loca-
tion is when deploying the application later. get_db returns a database connection, which is used to execute the
commands read from the file. 
"""

"""
click.command() defines a command line command called init-db that calls the init_db function and show a sucess message 
to the user. You can read this above document to learn more about writing commands:
https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/cli/
"""

# +-------------------------------+
# | Register with the application |
# +-------------------------------+

"""
The close_db and init_db_command functions need to be registred with the application instance; otherwise, they won't be
used by the application. However, since you're using a factory function, that instance isn't avaiable when writing the
function. Instead, write a function that takes an application and does the registration.
"""


def init_app(app):
    app.teardown_appcontext(close_db)
    app.cli.add_command(init_db_command)


"""
app.teardown_appcontext() tells Flask to call that function when clearing up after returning the reponse

app.cli.add_command() adds a new command that can be called with flask command.

import and call this function from the factory (__init__py). Place the new code at the end of the factory function 
before returning the app.
"""


# +------------------------------+
# | Initialize the Database File |
# +------------------------------+

"""
Now that init-db has been registered with the app, it can be called using the flask command, similar to the run command
from the __init__.py code.

    Note:
    if you're still running the server from the previous page, you can either stop the server, or run this command in a 
    new terminal. if you use a new terminal, remember to change to your project directory and activate the env.

run the init-db command:
    $ flask --app flaskr init-db
    Initialized the database

There will now be a flask.sqlite file in the instance folder in your project.
