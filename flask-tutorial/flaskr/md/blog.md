### Blog blueprint

You'll use the same techniques you learned about when writing the authentication blueprint to write the blog blueprint. The blog should list all posts, allow logged in users to create posts. and allow the author of a post to edit or delete it.

As you implement each view, keep the development server running. As you save your changes, try going to the URL in your browser and testing them out.
