# Quickstart

In this section you will take a quick look at Flask's many features. The documentation itself is as description in the code itself to speed up learning. Notice that the scripts are organized like this: a1, a2, a3, ... , b10, b11, ..., c21. This was done in order to put the scripts in reading order. You can also request them from the table below:
