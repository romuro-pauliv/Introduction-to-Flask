"""
In addition to the request object there is also a second object called session which allows you to store information
specific to a user from one request to the next. This is implemented on top of collies for you and signs the cookies
cryptographically. What this means is that the user could look at the contents of your cookie but not modify it, unless
they know the secret key used for sign-in.

In order to use sessions you have to set a secret key, Here is how sessions work:

app = Flask(__name__)


app.secret_key = b'_5#y2L"F4Q8z\n\xec]/'

def index():
    if 'username' in session:
        return f'Logged in as {session["username"]}'
    return 'You are not logged in'


@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        session['username'] = request.form['username']
        return redirect(url_for('index'))

        </form>

    #remove the username from the session if it's there
    session.pop('username', None)

"""
A secret key should be as random as possible. Your operation system has ways to generate pretty random data based on a 
cryptographic random generator. Use the following command to quickly generate a value for Flask.secret_key 
(or SECRET.KEY)

$ phython -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex())'

"""

"""
A note on collie based sessions: Flask will take the values you put into the session object and serialize them into a 
cookie. If you are finding some values do not persist across requests, cookies are indeed enabled, and you are not
getting a clear error message, check the suze of the cookie in your page responses compared to the size supported by web
browsers.

Besides the default client-side based sessions, if you want to handle sessions on the server-side instead, there are 
several Flask extensions that support this.
