"""
Sometimes you might be in a situation where you deal with data that should be correct, but actually is not. For example
you may have some client-side code that sends an HTTP request to the server but it's obviously malformed. This might be
caused by a user tampering with the data, or the client code failing. Most of the time it's okay to reply 400 
Bad Request in that situation, but sometimes that won't do and the code has to continue working

You may still want to log that something fishy happened. This is where loggers come in handy. As of Flask 0.3 a logger
is preconfigured for you to use.

Here are some examples log calls:
"""

# +--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
from flask import Flask
# +--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


app = Flask(__name__)


app.logger.debug('A value for debugging')
app.logger.warning('A warning occurred (%d apples)', 42)
app.logger.error('An error occurred')

"""
The attached logger is a standard logging Logger, so head over to the official logging docs for more information.
See: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/errorhandling/
