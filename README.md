# Introduction to Flask

Welcome th Flask's documentation. Informing the reader, this repository is **based completely on** the [official Flask documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/). The difference between this repository and the official documentation is that the repository has been adapted to make it easier to learn an run each script. One example is the [quickstart folder](https://github.com/romuro-pauliv/Introduction-to-Flask/tree/main/quickstart): by cloning the repository, it is extremely easy to run each script separately, speeding up and facilitating the learning of each function of the framework.

## User's Guide

Flask provides configuration and conventions, with sensible defaults, to get started. This section of the repository explains the different parts of the Flask framework and how they can be used, customized, and extended. Beyond Flask itself, look for community-maintained extensions to add even more functionality.
